Right so let's begin, I started this "guide" of sorts since I'm currently in a household of limited bandwidth and 4 heavy bandwidth users,
90% of this consists of just Steam, uPlay or Origin games, the original guide didn't make much sense to me as it was far too techncial, so I'm trying to simple it down here

So this lancache is super duper handy if you are hosting a lan party or if the people in your house / area of server are downloading games a lot, this cuts tons of bandwidth.
